I recently completed my summer internship at Rubrik Inc. in Palo Alto, 
California. I’m excited to share my experience with you.

I discovered Rubrik Inc. in my second year of college. Rubrik is a 
cybersecurity company that provides backup services to businesses.
The company was listed on Day 1 of my college internship process,
and the selection process had multiple rounds.

The first round was a test with four questions on Data Structures 
and Algorithms (DSA)/Competitive Programming (CP), each of increasing
difficulty. Around 10 students, including myself, were shortlisted
for interviews. The interviews were scheduled for the morning of the
first day and consisted of three back-to-back rounds. The first two
were technical interviews, and the third was a resume discussion.

The technical interviews involved one question each and lasted for
45-50 minutes. The questions were carefully designed to incorporate
various DSA concepts along with a bit of basic math. We were required
to write code (or pseudo-code if time was running short) after finding
the correct solution. The interviewers preferred a discussion-based
approach and helped guide us if we were thinking in the wrong direction,
making it important to think aloud.

My internship began in May, and it was a fantastic experience. Each
intern was assigned a different project and a mentor from the respective
team. My mentor was incredibly helpful, assisting me with problems
while also encouraging me to think independently for my growth.
This internship was a valuable learning experience.

The office culture at Rubrik was excellent. It was a hybrid setup,
so not everyone came to the office daily. Fortunately, my mentor was in
the office every day, which made it easier to get help. The work hours
were flexible, and I typically worked from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, with
breaks for lunch and snacks.

While I’m not sure if I can share the details of my project, I can say
it was an impactful and educational experience. There were also many
events organized for the intern cohort throughout the internship.

Overall, my internship at Rubrik was an amazing experience, filled
with both fun and challenges. I learned a lot and enjoyed every moment of it.
